# Guitar
An Implementation of https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/assignments/guitar.html in c++

---

This code implements the Karplus-Strong algorithm.
The current `main.cpp` file doesn't do anything productive due to lack of time to implement audio output.

In this project I tried out using __CMake__ and __Nix__ to manage my development environment.
I'd like to remark that I didn't format the code so you may see some spacing inconsistencies.
